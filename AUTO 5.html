            <br><strong>The shih Tzu</strong> is a <blockquote>dog with</blockquote> a small <del>muzzle</del> and normally has large dark brown eyes. The<em>Chinese</em> have described their head shapes as "owl head" and "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouths".[4] They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A <q>shih Tzu</q> should stand no more than <mark>26.7 cm (101‚ÅÑ2") </mark>at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lb).
