        <p>
            <br><strong>The shih Tzu</strong> is a sturdy dog with a small <del>muzzle</del> and normally has large dark brown eyes. The<em>Chinese</em> have described their head shapes as "owl head" and "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouths".[4] They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A <q>shih Tzu</q> should stand no more than <mark>26.7 cm (101‚ÅÑ2") </mark>at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lb). Floppy ears are covered with long fur, and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back.</br>The coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.[5] </p>
